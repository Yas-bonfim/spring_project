# spring_project

This project consist is a classification of types of flowers. The types analysed are: Sunflower, Daisy, Dandelion, Tulip and Rose. For this task, we used a kaggle dataset: final-flowers-course-project-dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishitchs/final-flowers-course-project-dataset).

Our project consists of a classification task. Firstly, we did Exploratory analyses to understand the data, but we had fewer images than necessary, so we used ImageDataGenerator to create more image data. After this, we used a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), which is naturally applied for images, and also we applied a K-fold method to improve our neural net learning.
